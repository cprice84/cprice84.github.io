    <h2 class="merriweather-header">My most recent story: Sign Guy wants you to see his positive messages, not know his name </h2>
   
    <p class="roboto-slab-body">Every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday — rain, shine or snow — a Syracuse University senior sits in a folding lawn chair in the same spot on the Shaw Quadrangle. For an hour or two, he holds up a whiteboard with a brief positive message. He rarely misses a day.
Passersby usually don’t spare him more than a brief glance, smile or sometimes a wave. But he doesn’t mind if people don’t react, he said. He knows he’s doing the right thing, and has been doing it since freshman year. Sign Guy, who studies neuroscience and data analytics, asked to be anonymous in this story. He believes the message is bigger than himself.
    </p>
    <h3 class="merriweather-header"> "Smile, Giggle, Laugh, repeat" </h3>
    <p class="roboto-slab-body">The idea to sit outside with a sign, and one of Sign Guy’s favorite messages, “Smile, giggle, laugh, repeat,” came from his grandfather.
For about two decades, Sign Guy’s grandfather sat at a roundabout in their small town in Vermont with his own sign, Sign Guy said. It began as a political protest to the United States’ invasion of Iraq in 2003.
As the conflict waned, his grandfather began to shift toward signs with more general messages of “peace, love and joy.” His grandfather moved to Oregon, and Sign Guy started college at SU.
Sign Guy said he knew he wanted to continue his grandfather’s tradition starting on his first day of college. He said telling his grandfather he planned to hold signs at SU was an emotional moment that strengthened their close childhood connection.</p>
