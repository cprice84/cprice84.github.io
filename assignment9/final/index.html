              <h1 class="merriweather-header"> How Farmer's markets are meeting the needs of people who use SNAP in Syracuse</h1>

              <p class="roboto-slab-body"> During the longest government shutdown in history, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients were thrown into the public spotlight as a chess piece in a bipartisan budget stalemate. That tension is especially top-of-mind for many in Syracuse, as Syracuse is one of the <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/data/2025/02/upstate-ny-cities-among-leaders-in-us-for-food-stamp-recipients.html"> leading cities in the nation </a> in amount of food stamp recipients.

          <div class="col-sm">
            <p class="roboto-slab-body">Farmers markets are an important part of filling that need with fresh, nutritious food. Ethan Tyo, a farm manager at Brady Farms, said buying food from farmer’s markets as opposed to big-box grocery stores is a more valuable experience.
                </p>
              <p class="roboto-slab-body"> “My ever ongoing battle is finding ways to talk to people about why it is that everyone goes to Walmart,” he said. “‘I grew up going to Walmart, why would I spend more money to get better quality produce? What do I get for that?’ And it's that connection, that relationship, that community, supporting each other that you can't quite do in a grocery store.”
             </p>

            <div class="col-sm">

                
                <p class="roboto-slab-body"> There are 10 farmers markets in Onondaga county. Three of those are Brady Farms farm stands, which accept SNAP along with three other farmer’s markets. Four do not. Only two farmer’s markets in the county are open year-round, while the rest operate mainly from June to November, limiting access to fresh food by season. 
                </p>
              <p class="roboto-slab-body">Accepting SNAP as a farmer’s market is a challenging process, Tyo said. Farmer’s markets deal with regulation barriers before they can accept SNAP, like the requirement that 50% of what they sell must be grown by them. Those requirements are hard to meet, especially for smaller farm stands, Tyo said. 
              </p>
              <p class="roboto-slab-body">On the market side, Tyo said following best practices in providing affordable, high quality food can also present challenges. 
              </p>
              <p class="roboto-slab-body">“It's a lot of problem solving, but it's really around this goal of how can we best get food into the community, while sustaining our operations,” he said.
              </p>
              <p class="roboto-slab-body">Brady Farms accepting SNAP opened the door to not only people struggling with financial barriers, but people with age, mobility and transportation barriers, Tyo said. SNAP isn’t the only way that farmer’s markets serve low-income communities.

                <p class="roboto-slab-body"> All farmer’s markets in Onondaga County also accept FreshConnect Checks (FCC). For every $5 in SNAP benefits a customer exchanges for wooden tokens, the manager may issue a $2 FreshConnect Check, which may be spent at the market on any SNAP eligible food item. This increases the purchasing power of SNAP benefits at farmer’s markets specifically. However, only three farmer’s markets in Onondaga County issue FCC. Brady farms also accepts coupons from the Women, Infants and Children Program (WIC), which runs from June to November.
                </p>
                <p class="roboto-slab-body">Tyo said a main source of revenue for Brady Farms is their Community Supported Agriculture program, a subscription service that delivers a box of 8-10 pieces of produce to participants’ homes on a weekly or biweekly basis from June to November. That revenue is what supports the business through the early parts of the year and allows Brady farms to accept so many subsidies, Tyo said.

                <p class="roboto-slab-body"> Despite the multiple programs increasing the spending power of SNAP dollars and supporting SNAP use at farmer’s markets, SNAP enrollment in Onondaga county has been decreasing since 2023, with the most dramatic decrease of 1,305 people on average coming from 2024-2025. 
                </p>
                <p class="roboto-slab-body">The 2025 decrease reflects a larger nationwide trend, as more than 645,000 people stopped receiving food assistance between January and May 2025, according to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/map-shows-where-snap-use-grown-shrunk-under-trump-11003857">Newsweek </a>. Newsweek quotes President Donald Trump criticizing the Biden administration for giving out SNAP assistance to too many people. The average of total SNAP persons peaked in Onondaga county at a monthly average of 68,319 in 2022.

              <p class="roboto-slab-body"> 
                The 2025 decrease in total SNAP persons doesn’t necessarily mean that fewer people need SNAP in Onondaga county, but that fewer people are eligible for it. Trump’s banner piece of legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill, limits SNAP eligibility. It expands work requirements for people to receive SNAP and makes “<a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/obbb-alien-eligibility"> lawfully present aliens </a>” ineligible. 
              </p>
                <p class="roboto-slab-body">Tyo grew up on SNAP, and said it was a long process to reshape his mindset from how to use food to get by to valuing food, its nutrition and the support it gives. 
                </p>
              <p class="roboto-slab-body">yo studies food studies at Syracuse University, and has dedicated his career to helping other people change that mindset and removing stigma around food assistance.
              </p> 
                <p class="roboto-slab-body">“People feel that food is almost like an objective,” he said. “ I believe food is a need, that’s an aspect, but then it's a community resource that needs to be shared and it should be thought of differently.”
                </p>
              <p class="roboto-slab-body">People who lost access to SNAP under Trump may never get the chance to change their relationship to food in that meaningful way as they lose access to the fresh produce farmers markets provide. 
              </p>
              <p class="roboto-slab-body">The impact of local farmer’s markets like Brady farms is meaningful to people, and makes Tyo proud to provide food for Syracuse, he said.  
              </p>
            <p class="roboto-slab-body">“When people hear that we take SNAP and we also sell organic produce at a reasonable cost, they light up,” Tyo said. “It's really exciting to be a producer in Syracuse. We're not just a central New York farmer, we are a South Side Syracuse producer of food for our community.”
