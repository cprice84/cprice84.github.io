    <h2>My most recent story</h2>
    <h3> Erie Canal’s bicentennial commemorates waterway’s history of ‘harm’</h3>
    <p>Despite the Erie Canal’s long history of connecting the United States and its strong ties to Syracuse, Robert Searing said the harm its construction caused is still tangible throughout the city.</p>
    <p>“Everything. The industry, Syracuse University, it’s all in one way or another connected to the canal and to the salt business,” Searing, Onondaga Historical Association’s curator of history, said. “As a city historian, I see legacies of the canal everywhere, throughout the city.”</p>
