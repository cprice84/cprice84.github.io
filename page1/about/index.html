      <h1>About me </h1>
      <p> I am a sophomore at Syracuse University studying magazine journalism with a minor in anthropology. I'm from Chicago and plan to move back there post-grad. I am currently an Assistant Culture Editor for The Daily Orange, Syracuse's independent student newspaper. </p>
  </b>
      <p> I chose to minor in anthropology because my favorite part of journalism is the people I meet. I wanted to learn more about how people are affected individually by larger social and cultural forces. I hope that my study of anthropology will help to give my writing an insightful perspective on how we live today. </p>
</b> 
      <p> I am looking for a summer internship where I can grow my reporting skills and knowledge of the journalism industry. When I graduate, I hope to work for a newspaper or magazine in Chicago. My dream job is to write for National Geographic.</p>
